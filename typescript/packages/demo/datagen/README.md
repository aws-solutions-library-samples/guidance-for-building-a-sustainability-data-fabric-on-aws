# SDF Demo Data Generator

## Overview

Generates the data required for step _4 - SDF Demo Data Generation_ of the demo flow.

## Execution

Note that pre-generated data (`materials.csv` and `invoices.csv`) is already committed to `/generatedResources`, but if you need to generate your own data then run the following:

```sh
df-sustainability/typescript/packages/demo/datagen> rushx "start:scope_3_purchased_goods"
```

Note: If you want to test how effective CaML is using the autogenerated materials written to `materials.csv`, run the following (will create `materials_matched.csv`):

```sh
df-sustainability/typescript/packages/demo/datagen> npx vitest -t 'caml'
```

## Deployment

Handled via the [DataGen stack](../../../../infrastructure/src/demo/demo.stack.ts).
